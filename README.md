SpiceCRM KREST API (Core Release)

Welcome to the KREST API

    KREST is the enhanced REST API that is built into SpiceCRM. If you are planning to use KReporter or SpiceCRM Mobile in conjunction with a regular SugarCRM system or SuiteCRM system you will need to download and install the KREST API since both components rely on this API and communicate with the backend systems using it.
    Continuously developed and updated to fit the latest technological trends

This is the public core release.

Webserver Prerequisites
